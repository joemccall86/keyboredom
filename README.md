Keyboredom
==========

Dynamic Keyboard Generation Tool

# Problem
Oh no! The folks at Spring are suffering from debilitating carpel tunnel
syndrome from making awesome software! What can we do?

# Solution
We can find out what kind of things they are typing so much and generate a
custom keyboard layout that they can use.

# Assumption
The frameworks they give the rest of us developers are so powerful that the
only explanation is that the entire staff at Spring are either robots or
superhumans. Either way the assumption is that there is a learning curve of 0
(that is, existing muscle memory is not taken into consideration).

# Technologies used
* Gradle
* Groovy
* Spring Integration
* MongoDB
